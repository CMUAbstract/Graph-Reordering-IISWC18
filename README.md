# Lightweight Graph Reordering (IISWC18)

Repo for the IISWC18 paper - "When is Graph Reordering an Optimization? 
Studying the Effect of Lightweight Graph Reordering Across Applications and Input Graphs"

## Contents

The repo contains source code for: 

* Packing Factor computation
* Lightweight Reordering techniques (incorporated in the GAP and Ligra benchmarks):
    * Hub Sorting
    * Hub Clustering

## Requirements

Ligra and GAP require g++ version >= 5.3.0

Both benchmark suites are parallelized with OpenMP

Tested on Debian Stretch with g++ version 6.3.0

## Issues
